# ToySocialNetwork

ToySocialNetwork is a project I made for my Advanced Programming Methods course in university.
It is a simple application, attempting to emulate the behaviour of actual social networks. 

## Features

Some of the features it has implemented are:
 - Support for multiple user accounts.
 - Support for establishing and manipulating connections between users in the form of `friend requests`.
 - Support for sending messages between connected users.

## Technologies used

A comprehensive list of all technologies used in this project:
 - Java, as the main, and only, programming language used.
 - JavaFX, used for the entirety of the application's graphic interface.
 - PostgreSQL, to ensure all of the data persisted between sessions.
